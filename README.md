# opentyrian-nx
Port of OpenTryian to the Nintendo Switch - going against standard practice, rather than just making the original source compilable for the Switch I've been removing code that is irrelevant to it. With the personal goal of gaining better knowledge of SDL2 and have simpler code specifically for the Switch.
